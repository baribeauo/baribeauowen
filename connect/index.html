				<h2>This Website</h2>
				<p>This website was created as a way to showcase some of my web design/development abilities, and as a home for some of my past work. It uses bold colours in combination a minimalistic, white design, allowing for the content to take centre stage. Upon refreshing the page, a different accent colour will be chosen at random.</p>

				<a href="../test/index.html" target="_blank"><h2>NXN.IO</h2></a>
				<p>This website was created for a fictional web app as a personal design challenge and procrastination tool. It makes use of a futuristic black and green colour scheme and gratuitous (perhaps too gratuitous) parallax scrolling effects. The navigational links do not direct anywhere meaningful. NXN.IO is a play on my middle name, Nixon.</p>

				<h2>Trivia Club Recruitment Poster</h2>
				<p>This poster was designed to be placed around the school in visible locations to attract new club members. Using a minimalistic design and a strong black background, this poster was designed for maximal visibility and impact. Additionally, it was designed in greyscale to save on printing costs.</p>

				<h2>Project Pulse Graphic</h2>
				<p>This is an image designed for posting on social media, sharing information about exec applications.</p>

				<h2>Waterloo Math T-Shirt</h2>
				<p>Was recruited to design T-shirts for the Waterloo Region Math Team as they travelled to the USA to compete in ARML 2016. </p>

				<h2>History Club Poster</h2>
				<p>I was tasked with designing a bright, colourful, bold poster that would look good from afar and communicate the most vital information about the club.</p>
				<hr class="afterImg">
				<img src="../images/test.png">
				<h2>Typography Graphic</h2>
				<p>A recreational design I created. Captures my passion for strong typography and simple design.</p>
				<hr class="afterImg">
				<img src="../images/ATLANTAballoons.png">
				<h2>Atlanta Hot Air Balloons</h2>
				<p>Another design exercise, creating branding for a fictional hot-air ballooon company. The design makes clever use of colour and directional arrows to emphasize the business (red up-arrows = hot air rising).</p>
				<hr class="afterImg">
				<h2>Other Web Design Experience</h2>
				<p>I have created and maintained a number of other websites that are no longer accessible on the internet. They include:
					<ul>
						<li>A website for my high school hockey team, including schedules, statistics, and important information for players</li>
						<li>A website as part of an anti-bullying initiative in high school, complete with various articles and links to other resources</li>
						<li>Multiple personal-portfolio websites for myself</li>
					</ul>
